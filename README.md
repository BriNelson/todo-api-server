# todo-api-server

npm install node 
<br>
npm install express
<br>
npm install node-fetch --- didn't really help me 

serving from static didn't really work, served from root folder worked (line 32 of index.js)


ISSUES
able to get json object from server, not able to do anything with it beside move it to anoter object, has no funciton afterwords that I can tell.

POST adds new item to object but is empty, not sure why


I don't know what im doing but i've done my best
